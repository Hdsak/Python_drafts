    "Welcome to the Deep Learning Lab. This homework exercise gives you a brief introduction to Python. Even if you've used Python before, this will help familiarize you with this environment as well as some functions we'll need throughout the next weeks.\n",
    "Most of the material in this notebook comes from Andrew Ng's [CS230](http://cs230.stanford.edu) course held at Stanford University.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After completing this assignment you will**\n",
    "* Be able to use iPython Notebooks\n",

    "* Be able to vectorize code\n",

    "**Instructions**\n",
    "* You'll be using Python 3 in the iPython-based Google Colaboratory\n",
    "* Lines marked by \"<font color='green'># TODO</font>\" denote the code fragments to be completed by you. There's no need to write any other code.\n",
    "* After writing your code, you can run the cell by either pressing \"SHIFT\"+\"ENTER\" or by clicking on the play symbol on the left side of the cell. \n",
    "* We may specify \"<font color='green'>(â‰ˆ X LOC)</font>\" in the \"<font color='green'># TODO</font>\" comments to tell you about how many lines of code you need to write. This is just a rough estimate, so don't feel bad if your code is longer or shorter.\n",
